# Nigeria-states-game

## A project written in python that shows the location of nigeria's states on its map based on user inputs.

This project was created to show the location of nigeria's states on its map. The following are how the projects works:
* The program starts with an empty nigerian flag. 
* The program requests a user input
* The user is to input a state of choice which will be automatically positioned on the map
* The program keeps looping until it gets to 36 and the states that were missed will be automatically generated in a csv file.
